# Restaurant Booking Frontend

The front-end part of restaurant booking plarform is developed to introduce a user-friendly interface for searching restaurant and managing reservations. Built with modern web technologies like React and Next.js, this project aims to provide a seamless interface and great experience for users, allowing them to easily browse restaurants, make reservations, and manage their bookings.

### Tech Stack
- React: For building the user interface.
- Next.js: For server-side rendering and routing.
- Tailwind: For easy and responsible styling using classes.
- Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- Clerk: To manage user authentication. (in-future is going to implement own auth with JWT-tokens )
